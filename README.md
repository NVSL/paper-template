## The Template

We will be using this template moving forward as the starting point for all papers.  You should fork the repo to create a new paper.

This repo works in conjunction with `libpaper` a set of common `.tex`, `.bib`, and other files we will use for writing papers.  That repo is here:  [git@github.com:NVSL/libpaper.git].  By default, the template use the `libpaper` in the parent directory, so you'll share one copy of `libpaper` for all papers.

## Usage

Create a new paper, you need to do:

```sh
$ libpaper/bin/newpaper.py --topic StarQuake --year 2019 --conference ASPLOS --github-user stevenjswanson
```

## Cool Tricks

`libpaper` provides a bunch of useful utilities and functions to make writing papers easier.  Please see the `README.md` in `libpaper` for details.
