# NVSL Paper Template

We will be using this template moving forward as the starting point for all papers.  You should fork the repo to create a new paper.

This repo works in conjunction with `libpaper` a set of common `.tex`, `.bib`, and other files we will use for writing papers.  That repo is here:  [git@github.com:NVSL/libpaper.git]
